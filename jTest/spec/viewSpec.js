describe("_____", function () {
    it("should ____", function () {

    });
});

Using describe() Blocks:
Jasmine uses a built-in describe block (it's actually a JavaScript function) to 
separate entire sets of functionality. The first parameter to the describe() is 
a name for the test "suite", and tells Jasmine (and yourself/other programmers) 
that everything inside this describe block is dealing with that specific part of 
your application.

Using it() Blocks:
Another built-in Jasmine block (function) is the it() block. This block represents 
a single unit test. You can have multiple it() blocks inside of one describe() block, 
which represent multiple unit tests inside of a "test suite." The first parameter to 
the it() block is an explanation of what the function you're testing should do. 
VERY commonly, it reads like a sentence beginning with the word "should"
